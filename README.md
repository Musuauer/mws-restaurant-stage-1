#### Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project of the Front-end nano-degree from Udacity, the student had to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. It also required the addition of a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.
